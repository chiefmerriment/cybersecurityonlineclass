    <h1 class="h1">INTRODUCTION TO CYBER SECURITY</h1>
    <p class="myp">Cybersecurity is the practice of
     protecting computer
     systems and networks from theft,
      damage, or u
      nauthorized access
      to the data they hold. It's a broad 
      field that covers 
      everything from securing
       your personal 
       computer to protecting entire
        organizations from cyberattacks.

    <h1 class="h1"> Why is cybersecurity important?</h1>
    <p class="myp">In today's interconnected world, we rely
     on technology for almost everything. This makes us 
     vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can have serious consequences.
      For individuals, a cyberattack can lead to identity 
      theft, financial loss, and even damage to their 
      reputation. For businesses, a cyberattack can result 
      in the loss of sensitive data, disruption of operations, and damage to their brand.

    <h1 class="o"> types of malware</h1>

    <p class="tp">VIRUSES: are a subgroup of malware. A virus is malicious software 
        attached to a document or file that 
        supports macros to execute its code and spread from
         host to host. Once downloaded, the virus will lie dormant
          until the file is opened and in use. Viruses are designed to disrupt a 
          system's ability to operate. As a result, viruses can cause significant
           operational issues and data loss.</p>
           <h1 class="oo">Worms</h1>
           <p class="top">A worm is a type of malicious software 
            that rapidly replicates and spreads
             to any device within the network. 
             Unlike viruses, worms do not need 
             host programs to disseminate.
              A worm infects a device through
               a downloaded file or a network connection
                before it multiplies and disperses at an
                 exponential rate. Like viruses, worms can severely
                  disrupt the operations of a device and
                   cause data loss</p>
                   <h1 class="op">Trojan virus</h1>
                   <p class="topic">Trojan viruses are disguised as helpful software programs.
                     But once the user downloads it,
                     
                     the Trojan virus can gain access to 
                     sensitive data and then modify, 
                     block, or delete the data.
                      This can be extremely harmful to the
                       performance of the device.
                        Unlike normal viruses and worms, 
                        Trojan viruses are not designed to 
                        self-replicate.</p>
                        <h1 class="pt">Spyware</h1>
                        <p class="topic">Spyware is malicious software that runs
                             secretly on a computer and reports back to a 
                             remote user. Rather than simply disrupting a device's
                              operations, spyware targets sensitive information and can grant
                               remote access to predators. Spyware is often used to
                                steal financial or personal information. A specific type of
                                 spyware is a keylogger, which records your keystrokes
                                  to reveal passwords and personal information.</p>
                                  <h1 class="py">Adware</h1>
                                  <p class="topii">Adware is malicious software used to collect data
                                     on your computer usage and provide appropriate 
                                     advertisements to you. While adware is not always
                                      dangerous, in some cases adware can cause issues 
                                      for your system. Adware can redirect your browser to
                                       unsafe sites, and it can even contain
                                        Trojan horses and spyware. Additionally, significant 
                                        levels of adware can slow down your system noticeably.
                                         Because not all adware is malicious, it is important to have
                                          protection that constantly and intelligently scans these programs.</p>
                                          <h1 class="pyi">Ransomware</h1>
                                          <p class="topiii">Ransomware is malicious software that gains access to
                                             sensitive information within a system, encrypts
                                              that information so that the user cannot access it,
                                               and then demands a financial payout for the data to be released.
                                                Ransomware is commonly part of a phishing scam. By clicking a 
                                                disguised link, the user downloads the ransomware. 
                                                The attacker proceeds to encrypt specific information that 
                                                can only be opened by a mathematical key they know. When the attacker receives payment, 
                                                the data is unlocked.</p>
                                                <h1 class="k">Fileless malware</h1>
                                                <p class="topiiii">Fileless malware is a type of memory-resident malware.

                                                      is malware that operates from a victim's

                                                       Because there are no files to scan, it is harder to

                                                       t also makes forensics more difficult because the malware 
                                                       disappears when the victim computer is rebooted. </p>
